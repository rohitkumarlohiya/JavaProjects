Spring-data-solr-example
========================

This is an example project to show some of the features of Spring Data Solr. It's the source I used for writing the blog post [Getting started with Spring Data Solr][1]

Have a look at [BookRepositoryTest][2] to see how to access Solr features with Spring Data Solr.
